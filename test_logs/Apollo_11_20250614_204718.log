  Okay, here’s a comprehensive summary of the Apollo 11 mission, incorporating the Wikipedia      
  article and the additional context gleaned from web searches:                                   
                                                                                                  
  **Apollo 11: A Historic Lunar Landing**                                                         
                                                                                                  
  The Apollo 11 mission, launched on July 16, 1969, represents a pivotal moment in human history –
  the first time humans walked on the Moon. The mission was a culmination of the United States’   
  ambitious “Project Apollo,” driven by the Cold War space race with the Soviet Union.            
                                                                                                  
  **Key Events & Personnel:**                                                                     
                                                                                                  
  • **Crew:** The mission was crewed by Commander Neil Armstrong, Command Module Pilot Michael    
  Collins, and Lunar Module Pilot Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin.                                            
  • **Launch & Initial Orbit:** The Saturn V rocket launched from Cape Kennedy (now Cape          
  Canaveral), Florida, initiating a journey into lunar orbit. The initial orbit was approximately 
  114 by 116 miles.                                                                               
  • **Lunar Module Descent:**  Armstrong and Aldrin entered the Lunar Module (LM), nicknamed      
  "Eagle," and began the descent to the lunar surface.  A critical moment occurred when the       
  Eagle’s computer nearly overloaded, forcing Armstrong to manually pilot the module to a safer   
  landing site in the Sea of Tranquility.                                                         
  • **First Steps & Exploration:** On July 20, 1969, at 4:17 PM EDT, Neil Armstrong took the first
  human step onto the Moon, uttering the iconic words, "That's one small step for a man, one giant
  leap for mankind.”  Aldrin followed shortly after. The astronauts spent approximately 2.5 hours 
  outside the LM, collecting samples, conducting experiments (including deploying a seismograph   
  and a laser ranging retroreflector), and planting the American flag.                            
  • **Return to Orbit & Rendezvous:** After their surface activities, Armstrong and Aldrin        
  returned to the Command Module, where Collins had been orbiting the Moon. The three astronauts  
  then performed a complex rendezvous maneuver to dock the Command Module with the Lunar Module.  
  • **Splashdown & Recovery:**  The crew splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on July 24, 1969, and 
  were recovered by the USS Hornet.                                                               
                                                                                                  
  **Significant Technological Achievements & Data Collected:**                                    
                                                                                                  
  • **Lunar Surface Exploration:** The mission provided the first direct observation of the lunar 
  surface, allowing scientists to study its geology, composition, and history.                    
  • **Scientific Instruments:** The deployment of the seismograph and laser ranging retroreflector
  enabled scientists to study moonquakes and measure the distance between the Earth and the Moon  
  with unprecedented accuracy.                                                                    
  • **Photographic and Video Documentation:** The mission produced a wealth of photographic and   
  video documentation, including the famous footage of Armstrong’s first steps and the exploration
  of the lunar surface.                                                                           
  • **Sample Collection:** The astronauts collected approximately 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar  
  rocks and soil, which were brought back to Earth for detailed analysis.                         
                                                                                                  
  **Legacy:**                                                                                     
                                                                                                  
  Apollo 11 remains a symbol of human ingenuity, courage, and the pursuit of exploration. It      
  demonstrated the power of scientific collaboration and inspired generations to dream of reaching
  for the stars. The mission’s data continues to be studied and analyzed, furthering our          
  understanding of the Moon and the solar system.                                                 
                                                                                                  
  Do you want me to elaborate on a specific aspect of the mission (e.g., the technical challenges,
  the scientific discoveries, the cultural impact)?

  According to the document and the supplemental search results, the Apollo program’s cost is a   
  significant figure. The document states that at the peak of Apollo program spending in 1966,    
  NASA accounted for roughly 4.4% of the federal budget. The search results provide more detailed 
  figures. At the peak of Apollo program spending, the program cost $283 billion (in 1969         
  dollars). Adjusted for inflation to 2024, this equates to approximately $2.8 trillion.          
  Furthermore, the cost of the Vietnam War from 1965-1975 was $111 billion (or $686 billion in    
  2008                                                                                            
  US dollars), which is significantly less than the overall investment in the Apollo program.     
  Therefore, the Apollo program represented a substantial financial commitment, totaling roughly  
  $2.8 trillion in today’s dollars.

  Okay, here’s a comprehensive summary of the Apollo 11 mission, incorporating the Wikipedia      
  article and the additional context gleaned from the web searches:                               
                                                                                                  
  **Apollo 11: A Historic Lunar Landing**                                                         
                                                                                                  
  The Apollo 11 mission, launched on July 16, 1969, represents a pivotal moment in human history –
  the first time humans walked on the Moon. The mission was a culmination of the United States’   
  ambitious “Space Race” effort against the Soviet Union and was driven by President John F.      
  Kennedy’s declaration in 1961 to land a man on the Moon before the end of the decade.           
                                                                                                  
  **The Crew and the Journey:**                                                                   
                                                                                                  
  The crew consisted of:                                                                          
                                                                                                  
  • **Neil Armstrong:** Commander                                                                 
  • **Michael Collins:** Command Module Pilot                                                     
  • **Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin:** Lunar Module Pilot                                                   
                                                                                                  
  The mission began with a launch from Cape Kennedy (now Cape Canaveral), Florida, aboard a Saturn
  V rocket. The initial phase involved achieving a circular orbit around Earth.  After            
  approximately 10 hours, the spacecraft separated into two modules: the Command Module (CM)      
  piloted by Michael Collins, and the Lunar Module (LM) piloted by Armstrong and Aldrin. The LM   
  then executed a complex series of maneuvers to propel it towards the Moon.                      
                                                                                                  
  **The Lunar Landing:**                                                                          
                                                                                                  
  On July 20, 1969, Armstrong and Aldrin entered the LM, named "Eagle," and began their descent to
  the lunar surface.  The landing was fraught with challenges; the onboard computer was           
  overloaded, and Armstrong had to manually override the controls to avoid a rocky crater.  At    
  4:17:40 PM EDT, the Eagle touched down in the Sea of Tranquility. Armstrong famously announced, 
  "Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed."                                         
                                                                                                  
  **First Steps and Activities:**                                                                 
                                                                                                  
  • **Neil Armstrong:** As the first human to set foot on the Moon, Armstrong uttered the iconic  
  words, "That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind."                           
  • **Buzz Aldrin:** Shortly after, Aldrin joined him on the surface.                             
  • **Activities:** The astronauts spent approximately 2.5 hours outside the LM, conducting       
  experiments, collecting lunar samples (approximately 47.5 pounds), planting the American flag,  
  and taking photographs. They deployed a television camera to transmit images back to Earth.     
                                                                                                  
  **Return to Earth:**                                                                            
                                                                                                  
  After their surface activities, Armstrong and Aldrin returned to the LM, and the Eagle lifted   
  off from the Moon to rendezvous with the Command Module, piloted by Michael Collins, which had  
  remained in lunar orbit. The crew then began their journey back to Earth.  The splashdown       
  occurred on July 24, 1969, in the Pacific Ocean, where the astronauts were recovered by the USS 
  Hornet.                                                                                         
                                                                                                  
  **Significance:**                                                                               
                                                                                                  
  The Apollo 11 mission was a monumental achievement in engineering, science, and human           
  exploration. It demonstrated the power of American innovation and inspired a generation. The    
  mission’s legacy continues to shape our understanding of the universe and our place within it.  
                                                                                                  
  **Visual Documentation:**                                                                       
                                                                                                  
  The mission was extensively documented through photographs and video footage, many of which     
  remain iconic representations of human achievement.  The images captured by the astronauts,     
  particularly those taken by Buzz Aldrin from the lunar surface, are among the most recognizable 
  images in history.                                                                              
                                                                                                  
  --------                                                                                        
                                                                                                  
  Do you want me to elaborate on a specific aspect of the mission (e.g., the technical challenges,
  the scientific experiments, the cultural impact)?

  According to the document content and the provided search results, the Apollo program cost a    
  substantial amount. The document states that “The United States spent $25.8 billion on Project  
  Apollo between 1960 and 1973”. Furthermore, the search results indicate that when adjusted for  
  inflation to 2020 dollars, this equates to approximately $280 billion. It’s also noted that the 
  cost of the Vietnam War from 1965-1975 was $111 billion or $686 billion in 2008 US dollars,     
  illustrating a significant investment in the Apollo program.

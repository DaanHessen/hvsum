  Okay, here’s a comprehensive summary of Apollo 11, incorporating the Wikipedia article and the  
  additional context gleaned from web searches:                                                   
                                                                                                  
  **Apollo 11: A Historic Lunar Landing**                                                         
                                                                                                  
  Apollo 11 was NASA’s first crewed mission to land on the Moon, a pivotal moment in human history
  and a defining achievement of the Space Race. Launched on July 16, 1969, from Cape Kennedy (now 
  Cape Canaveral), Florida, the mission carried Commander Neil Armstrong, Command Module Pilot    
  Michael Collins, and Lunar Module Pilot Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin.                                    
                                                                                                  
  **Mission Highlights & Timeline:**                                                              
                                                                                                  
  • **Launch & Earth Orbit:** The Saturn V rocket successfully launched, placing the spacecraft   
  into a 114 by 116-mile Earth orbit.                                                             
  • **Trans Lunar Injection (TLI):** On July 19, the spacecraft executed a critical maneuver – TLI
  – to break free from Earth’s gravity and begin its journey to the Moon.                         
  • **Lunar Orbit Insertion (LOI):** July 20, the spacecraft entered lunar orbit.                 
  • **Lunar Module Descent:** Armstrong and Aldrin entered the Lunar Module (LM) – nicknamed      
  “Eagle” – and descended to the lunar surface. The descent was fraught with challenges, including
  alarms indicating a dangerously steep slope, and ultimately, the crew had to manually override  
  the landing system.                                                                             
  • **First Steps & Exploration:** At 4:17 PM EDT on July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong took “one small
  step for a man, one giant leap for mankind,” becoming the first human to walk on the Moon.      
  Aldrin followed shortly after. The astronauts spent approximately 2.5 hours outside the LM,     
  collecting samples, conducting experiments, planting the American flag, and taking photographs. 
  • **Return to Orbit & Rendezvous:** After their surface activities, the astronauts returned to  
  the Command Module “Columbia,” piloted by Michael Collins, which had remained in lunar orbit.   
  The three astronauts then rendezvoused and prepared for the journey back to Earth.              
  • **Splashdown:** On July 24, 1969, the Command Module splashed down safely in the Pacific Ocean,
  where they were recovered by the USS Hornet.                                                    
                                                                                                  
  **Key Figures & Technology:**                                                                   
                                                                                                  
  • **Neil Armstrong & Buzz Aldrin:** The courageous astronauts who made history.                 
  • **Michael Collins:** The pilot of the Command Module, responsible for maintaining orbit and   
  awaiting the return.                                                                            
  • **Saturn V Rocket:** The massive, multi-stage rocket that propelled the spacecraft to the Moon.
  • **Lunar Module (Eagle):** The specialized vehicle designed for landing and ascent from the    
  lunar surface.                                                                                  
  • **Command Module (Columbia):** The primary spacecraft for the return journey.                 
                                                                                                  
  **Significance & Legacy:**                                                                      
                                                                                                  
  Apollo 11 was a monumental achievement that demonstrated the power of human ingenuity,          
  engineering, and determination. It captivated a global audience, inspired generations, and      
  cemented America’s position as a leader in space exploration. The mission’s data and samples    
  continue to be studied today, furthering our understanding of the Moon and the solar system.    
  The images and footage from the mission remain iconic and are frequently referenced as a symbol 
  of human achievement.

  The descent was fraught with challenges, including alarms indicating a dangerously steep slope, 
  and ultimately, the crew had to manually override the landing system.

  Based on the available information, the total cost of the Apollo program, adjusted for inflation
  to 2024 dollars, was approximately $28 billion.                                                 
                                                                                                  
  Here’s a breakdown of the figures:                                                              
                                                                                                  
  • **Original 1969 Costs:** The Saturn I and IB rockets cost $1.3 billion in 1960s dollars, or   
  $13 billion when adjusted for inflation to 2024.                                                
  • **Total Adjusted Cost (2024):**  A more comprehensive analysis, incorporating the full Apollo 
  program (including Gemini and robotic lunar programs), estimates the total cost at $28 billion  
  when adjusted to 2024 dollars. This figure represents a significant investment, highlighting the
  immense technological and engineering undertaking involved in reaching the moon.                
                                                                                                  
  It's important to note that different sources utilize varying methodologies for calculating     
  inflation-adjusted costs, resulting in slightly differing totals. However, $28 billion          
  represents                                                                                      
  a generally accepted estimate based on the available data.

  After their surface activities, the astronauts returned to the Command Module “Columbia,”       
  piloted by Michael Collins, which had remained in lunar orbit. The three astronauts then        
  rendezvoused and prepared for the journey back to Earth.
